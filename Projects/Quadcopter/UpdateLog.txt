- After the motors went out of sync last session and Motor 4 failed , we replaced the motor with a new one. Today when attempting to 
recalibrate the rest of the motors were succesfully in synce excpet Motor 4 which worked in delay compared to the others with 
a high pitched sound. This led us to believe that the issue is with the ESC Connected to Motor 4. We confirmed this by switching ESC 3
with ESC 4 and Motor 4 worked well in sync with the others.
